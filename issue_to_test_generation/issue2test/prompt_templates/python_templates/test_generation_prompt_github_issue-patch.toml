## Overview - Github Issue
You are an expert software engineer code assistant tasked with generating test cases for a given GitHub issue.
Your objective is to add new unit tests to the existing test suite.

### Github Issue:
### GitHub Problem Description ###
{{ github_issue }}

### Guidelines:
1. Analyze the GitHub issue requirements.
2. Read existing Test Cases.
3. Ensure new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure. Assume new tests are part of the same suite if a test suite exists.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `{{ source_file_name }}`.
We have manually added line numbers to assist in understanding the code coverage.
These line numbers are not part of the original code.

=========
{{ source_file_numbered|trim }}
=========

## Test File
Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `{{ test_file_name }}`.
=========
{{ test_file| trim }}
=========


{%- if failed_tests_section|trim  %}

{{ failed_tests_section|trim }}

{% endif %}

## Response
Please output only the Git diff as if the new tests were being added to the existing test file. The diff should be directly applicable using git apply patch.diff.
