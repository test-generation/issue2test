Task: Analyze Potential Causes for a GitHub Issue

We have an issue reported in our GitHub repository (called ###PROJECT NAME###). Below is the issue description:

###ISSUE DESCRIPTION###

Hypothesize the most likely sets of exclusive causes, aiming for at most three well-reasoned sets. This analysis will assist in reproducing the issue (e.g., by creating a piece of code or a test case that replicates the problem).
What We Mean by "Sets of Causes and Reasons":

    Issue Context: GitHub issues typically include a brief explanation, a snippet of code, and/or an error message. These provide clues about the underlying problem.
    Sets of Exclusive Causes: The issue may stem from multiple potential reasons. Some of these causes might be independent, while others may be mutually exclusive.
        Independent Causes: Two or more causes may coexist to explain the issue.
        Exclusive Causes: Certain causes cannot coexist; if one set of reasons (e.g., A and B) is valid, then another (e.g., C) must be invalid, and vice versa.

Your Task:
Hypothesize the most likely sets of exclusive causes that could explain the issue, based on the provided description. Structure each set with a clear title and list the reasons it includes. If possible, organize related reasons logically to ensure clarity.
Output Format:

Your output must follow this format strictly:

According to my analysis, the issue in hand could have been caused by one of the following sets of reasons:

BEGIN REASONS SET: (Provide a descriptive title for this set)
	- Reason 1
	- Reason 2
	...
END REASONS SET: (Repeat the same title here)

BEGIN REASONS SET: (Provide a descriptive title for this set)
	- Reason 1
	- Reason 2
	...
END REASONS SET: (Repeat the same title here)

BEGIN REASONS SET: (Provide a descriptive title for this set)
	- Reason 1
	- Reason 2
	...
END REASONS SET: (Repeat the same title here)
