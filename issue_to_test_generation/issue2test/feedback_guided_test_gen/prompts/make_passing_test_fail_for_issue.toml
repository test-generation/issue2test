The following GitHub issue needs to be addressed:
{{ github_issue }}

### Passing Test Case (Incorrectly Passes)
The following test case currently **passes**, even though the GitHub issue has **not** been resolved yet:
{{ passing_test }}

### Task
Modify the test case so that:
- It **fails on the current version of the code**, ensuring it correctly detects that the issue is unresolved.
- It **passes only after the issue is resolved**.
- The failure is **caused by the absence of the expected fix or feature**.
- It follows **correct Python syntax** and is **formatted properly**.

### Output Format (JSON)
Return a JSON object containing only the modified test code.

- `"modified_test"`: A **string containing the updated test case**, formatted as valid Python.
- The test case **must be properly indented** and **syntactically correct**.

Ensure the response contains **only valid Python code** without explanations or additional text.
