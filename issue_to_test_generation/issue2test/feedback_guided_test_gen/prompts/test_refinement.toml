The current test case includes assertions that do not directly address the GitHub issue and may pass even though the issue is not yet implemented.
Your task is to refine the test case to focus specifically on the functionality described in the issue, ensuring it fails due to the unimplemented feature or unresolved bug.

### GitHub Issue:
{{ github_issue }}

### Assertion Failure Details:
{{ assertion_error_message }}

### Instructions:
Please provide an updated version of the test case that:
1. Focuses only on assertions relevant to the issue requirements.
2. Removes any assertions unrelated to the issue.
3. Ensures the test will fail initially due to the feature being unimplemented.

## Response
Make sure to output revised test case code only, without additional comments."""
