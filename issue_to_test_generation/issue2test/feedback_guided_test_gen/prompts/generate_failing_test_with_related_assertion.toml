The following GitHub issue needs to be addressed:

The source code that is being tested is:
{{ source_code }}

A test case was previously generated, but it fails with an unrelated assertion error:
{{ unrelated_assertion_test }}

Please generate a new test case that directly addresses the issue described in the GitHub issue and ensure that it fails because of that specific issue.
The test case should highlight the issue in the GitHub issue and make sure it fails.
Make sure your response contains only the corrected code, without additional comments.
