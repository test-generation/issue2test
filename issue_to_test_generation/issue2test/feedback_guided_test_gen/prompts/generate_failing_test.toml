The current test case includes assertions that do not directly address the GitHub issue and is passing even though the issue is not yet implemented.

The following GitHub issue needs to be addressed:
{{ github_issue }}.

The source code that is being tested is:
{{ source_code }}

A test case was previously generated, but it is currently passing, even though the issue is not yet addressed:
{{ passing_test }}

Please generate a new test case that specifically targets the unimplemented functionality described in the GitHub issue.
This test case should highlight the missing feature or unresolved bug by creating targeted assertions that expose the absence of the required functionality.
Make sure to output running code only, without additional comments.
